#south shoji
One long hall, with a high ceiling of plain wood planks, is separated into four rooms by sliding shoji.|250|
The floor in each room is tiled by { eight } tatami. The whole hall has a slight odor of dry grass.|100|
  eight: Two tatami run lengthwise in the center of the room. They are capped by a tatami on either end. Four tatami flank the space.
Standing in the southern room and looking north feels like being in a ribbed train { tunnel }.|50|
  tunnel: the rooms in the center of the hall are intentionally darker than those at the end, so no matter where you stand you have the impression of being deep inside, looking out.
Bright light from the deck falls in harsh shafts through the [ south-east door | long hall deck south ].|250|
A softer light filters though the square rice paper panels of the east wall.|30|
The room is dominated by the view [ north | middle shoji ], room after room of sliding panels capped by an unassuming low table.|100|
However, the opaque pale beige { screens } that separate each room, and adorn the west wall, also tug at your attention.|20|
  screens: Each screen was delicately painted with some natural seen; some of the paintings are hundreds of years old and are faded beyond recognition.

#middle shoji
One long hall, with a high ceiling of plain wood planks, is separated into four rooms by sliding shoji.|100|
The floor in each room is tiled by { eight } tatami. The whole hall has a slight odor of dry grass.|50|
  eight: Two tatami run lengthwise in the center of the room. They are capped by a tatami on either end. Four tatami flank the space.
The light here is exclusively that which { filters } through the square rice paper panels on the east wall.|50|
  filters: There is no artificial light, and at night the hall is pitch black. Few people know this, because no one really uses the hall.
Looking [ north | tokonoma shoji ] or [ south | south shoji ] you feel as though you are { peering } out from the ribs of a well preserved { fossil }.|30|
  peering: Here, near the middle of the long hall, the light is very dim. The bright lights at either end play tricks on your night-vision.
  fossil: Even the plants are dead, in a sense: the gardens have not changed in decades, and every flower is exactly where is was last spring.
At the [ north | tokonoma shoji ] end of the hall, past two more sliding screens, there is a small table set against glowing rice paper panels.|40|
Painted on the opaque beige shoji making up the western wall is a seen of a whether worn { coast }.|20|
  coast: You can barely make out the outline of a boat, sailing away.

#second garden
The air here is cold, there is a { breeze }. It was much warmer [ inside | north garden view ]. |15|
  breeze: Maybe you should move back inside?
The second garden is more of a back yard. It is more a thing of accidental beauty than the garden guests are shown.|10|
The little girl looks up at you as you approach. She considers you gravely.|6|
"てんぐ、ね？" she says sympathetically, pointing at her nose.|4|
"はい", the girl mumbles as she reaches into her sode and produces a tiny { candy }, wrapped in colorful foil. "これ、あげるから" she smiles, handing you the candy. |2|
  candy: It is orange flavor.
