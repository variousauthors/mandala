#south shoji
One long hall, with a heigh ceiling of plane wood planks, is separated into four rooms by sliding shoji.|250|
The floor in each room is tiled by { eight } tatami. The whole hall has a slight odor of dry grass.|100|
  eight: Two tatami run lengthwise in the center of the room. They are capped by a tatami on either end. Four tatami flank the space.
Standing in the southern room and looking north feels like being in a ribbed train { tunnel }.|50|
  tunnel: the rooms in the center of the hall are intentionally darker than those at the end, so no matter where you stand you have the impression of being deep inside, looking out.
Bright light from the deck falls in harsh shafts through the [ south-east door | long hall deck south ].|250|
A softer light filters though the square rice paper panels of the east wall.|30|
The room is dominated by the view [ north | middle shoji ], room after room of sliding panels capped by an unassuming low table.|100|
However, the opaque pale beige { screens } that separate each room, and adorn the west wall, also tug at your attention.|20|
  screens: Each screen was delicately painted with some natural seen; some of the paintings are hundreds of years old and are faded beyond recognition.

#middle shoji
One long hall, with a heigh ceiling of plane wood planks, is separated into four rooms by sliding shoji.|100|
The floor in each room is tiled by { eight } tatami. The whole hall has a slight odor of dry grass.|50|
  eight: Two tatami run lengthwise in the center of the room. They are capped by a tatami on either end. Four tatami flank the space.
The light here is exclusively that which { filters } through the square rice paper panels on the east wall.|50|
  filters: There is no artificial light, and at night the hall is pitch black. Few people know this, because no one really uses the hall.
Looking [ north | tokonoma shoji ] or [ south | south shoji ] you feel as though you are { peering } out from the ribs of a well preserved { fossil }.|30|
  peering: Here, near the middle of the long hall, the light is very dim. The bright lights at either end play tricks on your night-vision.
  fossil: Even the plants are dead, in a sense: the gardens have not changed in decades, and every flower is exactly where is was last spring.
At the [ north | tokonoma shoji ] end of the hall, past two more sliding screens, there is a small table set against glowing rice paper panels.|40|
Painted on the opaque beige shoji making up the western wall is a seen of a whether worn { coast }.|20|
  coast: You can barely make out the outline of a boat, sailing away.

#tokonoma shoji

The floor in each room is tiled by { eight } tatami. The whole hall has a slight odor of dry grass.|50|
  eight: Two tatami run lengthwise in the center of the room. They are capped by a tatami on either end. Four tatami flank the space.

  filters: There is no artificial light, and at night the hall is pitch black. Few people know this, because no one really uses the hall.
Looking [ north | tokonoma shoji ] or [ south | south shoji ] you feel as though you are { peering } out from the ribs of a well preserved { fossil }.|30|
  peering: Here, near the middle of the long hall, the light is very dim. The bright lights at either end play tricks on your night-vision.
  fossil: Even the plants are dead, in a sense: the gardens have not changed in decades, and every flower is exactly where is was last spring.
At the [ north | tokonoma shoji ] end of the hall, past another more sliding screen, there is a small table set against glowing rice paper panels.|40|
In the south-west corner of the room there is a tiny { tokonoma }, half as high as a man, inset into the wall.|20|
  tokonoma: There is a tiny red flower in a grown clay vase, pushed back into the corner of the tokonoma. On the wall hangs a scroll, depicting a peasant working in a potato field.
Unlike the rest of these rooms, the west wall is not made of opaque beige painted screens. It is humble, earthy clay and old wood. |15|
A single raw branch of dark wood is set into the wall, and separates the right and left side of the wall.|10|

#small table shoji
One long hall, with a heigh ceiling of plane wood planks, is separated into four rooms by sliding shoji.|250|
The floor in each room is tiled by { eight } tatami. The whole hall has a slight odor of dry grass.|100|
  eight: Two tatami run lengthwise in the center of the room. They are capped by a tatami on either end. Four tatami flank the space.
Standing in the northern room and looking [ south | tokonoma shoji ] feels like staring at a mise en abyme, echoing the same minimalist aesthetic again and again.|100|
In the center of the room is a low, flat table made of smooth, dark wood.|75|
On either side of the table there is a cushion, laying on the tatami.|40|
There is a bowl in the center of the table, blue and white painted { china }.|30|
  china: The light from the door catches elegantly on the small ceramic dish.
The table is set with two simple rough pieces of cloth, one on the west and one on the east.|25|
On each piece of cloth there is a chopstick stand and two chopsticks.|20|
Beside the chopsticks, there is a tiny flat cup barely half an ounce.|15|
Actually, one of the cushions looks to have been sat in recently.|10|
And in the other, there is a young man. You did not notice him before entering the room.|6|
When he sees you he stands up immediately. His smile is warm.|4|
"おかえり。" he says, smiling for just a moment.|2|
Light pours into this room, from a door in the [ south-east | long hall northeast ] corner.|250|
The sun shinning in from the south-east is a grid of light and shadow.|40|
Thin rice paper panels make up the north and east walls, and there is an open sliding screen in the [ north-west | north garden view ] corner.|50|

#north garden view
There is a room behind the [ long hall | small table shoji ] that overlooks a second { garden }.|50|
  garden: This one is not fenced in, though. A pond marks the end of it, unofficially.
The north wall of this intimate room is dominated by a swirling landscape of color { squeezed } between pale white sliding doors.|25|
  squeezed: And a pale white.
Just [ outside | second garden ] there is a small deck, made of a light { wood } different from the other decks. |15|
  wood: And pale white planks.
Overhanging the deck is a gnarly old { pine } tree, which lists to the left.|20|
  pine: There are no pine needles on the deck though.
The arms of the pine tree stretch out over a small, well combed sand garden.|20|
In the garden there are mossy stones drifting between the waves of diffuse beige sand.|15|
The sand garden borders a tiny { shallow } pool, fed from the surrounding forest.|10|
  shallow: It is so reflective that squeezes the trees and hills beyond up against the sky.
A child is sitting on the deck, playing a { flute } poorly. Her legs dangle into the garden.|6|
  flute: Or maybe she is playing well, but in a way that you fail to appreciate?
The beige and blue landscape of the garden is pressed flat by the forest and hills beyond.|25|
Bright red and orange flowers, or wild fruit bearing trees, growing out there forever beyond our control.|25|

#second garden
The air here is cold, there is a { breeze }. It was much warmer [ inside | north garden view ]. |15|
  breeze: Maybe you should move back inside?
The second garden is more of a back yard. It is more a thing of accidental beauty than the garden guests are shown.|10|
The little girl looks up at you as you approach. She considers you gravely.|6|
"てんぐ、ね？" she says sympathetically, pointing at her nose.|4|
"はい", the girl mumbles as she reaches into her sode and produces a tiny { candy }, wrapped in colorful foil. "これ、あげるから" she smiles, handing you the candy. |2|
  candy: It is orange flavor.

#long hall deck south
What you can see of the garden, between the beams of wood that fence in the deck, is broken down into a barcode of { blue } and brown.|500|
  blue: You can barely resolve any single shape. The most distinct feature, from this perspective, is the blue sky.
Though the effect of the beams is clever, it is also { claustrophobic }.|100|
  claustrophobic: There are obvious parallels to be made.
If you press your face up against the beams, you can { feel } as though they are not there.|50|
  feel: You feel the warm wood press against your cheeks.
The deck feels like an uncomfortable place half-way { between } the house and garden.|25|
  between: Some people feel comfortable with their backs to the wall.
It continues [ north | long hall deck garden entrance ], where you can see the beams give way and there is a step down into the garden.|500|
There is also sliding screen door here that opens into the [ interior | south shoji ] of the house. An empty room with painted walls.|200|

#long hall deck northeast
What you can see of the garden, between the beams of wood that fence in the deck, is broken down into a barcode of { green } and brown.|500|
  green: You can barely resolve any single shape. The most distinct feature, from this perspective, is the mossy green landscape.
Though the effect of the beams is clever, it is also { claustrophobic }.|100|
  claustrophobic: You can not help but wonder what the deck looks like from the garden.
If you press your face up against the beams, you can { feel } as though they are not there.|50|
  feel: You feel the warm sun on your forehead.
The deck feels like an uncomfortable place half-way { between } the house and garden.|25|
  between: If you are not careful, you might end up trapped here by indecision.
It continues [ south | long hall deck garden entrance ], where you can see the beams give way and there is a step down into the garden.|500|
There is also sliding screen door here that opens into the [ interior | small table shoji ] of the house. A small room with a low wooden table.|250|
