#caper double
At the top of the stairs, there is a corridor to [[your left|candor]], and one to [[your right|devil]], both lined with doors.
In addition, the stairs continue [[ahead of you|eager]], up to a third floor.
You can hear the conversation now as a blurred murmur, but there is little chance of you joining them now.




#angle
The foyer itself is small and of little interest.
There is a carpet, a closet where you believe your jacket might be, and a [[staircase|brunt]] to the interior balcony, the second floor, and presumably, the washroom.
There are a number of other doors and hallways leading away to rooms that do not interest you.
The stairs will put the most matter between you and the conversations going on behind you.



#brunt
On your way up the stairs, you pause to admire the myriad photos and portraits.
Some of these photos must be as old as photography.
The drawn portraits show you more than photos: not just how people were but how they were meant to be.
You imagine the conversations they must have had with each-other, the steps on this staircase.
Soon you are standing at the [[top of the stairs|caper]].



#caper
At the top of the stairs you are momentarily confused.
There is a corridor to [[your left|candor]], and one to [[your right|devil]], both lined with doors.
In addition, the stairs continue [[ahead of you|eager]], up to a third floor.
You can hear the conversation now as a blurred murmur.
Did your host mean "right, at the top of the stairs" or "right at the top of the stairs"? Did she mean these stairs, or all the stairs.
You stand paralyzed for a moment: none of these doors immediately says "washroom".
There is a smile on your face when you realize that you will have to try them all.
There is no chance of you going back down without having found the washroom; imagine the brainless comments your company might make!
Fate has given you this chance to avoid the party.
You go looking for the washroom.



#devil
You turn to face down the hallway to your right.
The right wall of the hallway is lined with family photos of a more contemporary kind: graduation photos, children with their dogs, a father holding his newborn daughter.
At the end of the hallway, there is a [[glass door|devil arts]] out to a raised terrace.
On your left, closer to the stairs, is a wooden [[door|devil brats]].
Turn back to the [[top of the stairs|caper double]].



#candor
You turn to face the hallway on your left.
The hallways is lined with doors.
There are two doors on your right, a small simple looking [[door|candor arbor]], and a [[door|candor bramble]] with a poster hung on it.
There is one [[door|candor denver]] on your left, past the balcony.
There is a tall [[cabinet|candor eagle]] at the end of the hall.
The balcony itself is quite nice: elegant wooden poles support a white painted bannister.
The foyer down below is a dancefloor for the gently waving { shadows } slipping out of the dinning room.
Head back to the [[top of the stairs|caper double]].
  shadows: somehow they far outshine their owners.



#eager
You resolve to walk to the top of the stairs.
You ascend another flight, this one walled on both sides and with less old photos.
The walls of the staircase are hung with trophies from walks on the beach: they are out of place among the other paraphernalia you have seen.
There are flat bits of dry driftwood, and smooth rocks on little shelves nailed into the wall.
The room at the top of the stairs is a large open area, divided not by walls but by function.
There is a [[small kitchen|eager aunt]], a ricketty [[door|eager beaver]] onto an outdoor balcony, and a [[small studio space|eager crabby]].
You can also walk [[down the stairs|caper double]] into the rest of the house.

You can also walk [[down the stairs|caper double]] into the rest of the house.



#candor arbor
You open the door and pull a dangling chain to turn on the lights (you will remember to turn them off again when you [[leave|candor]], no doubt).
This tiny room is a fully stocked pantry: there are boxes of healthy cereals, jams in jars, and a variety of dry goods and unperishables.
There is also [[a small door|second home foyer powder]] beneath a shelf on the right side of the room, about a meter tall.
You presume it leads to storage beneath the stairs.



#eager aunt
The little kitchen looks to have been made for smaller people.
There is a stool here for a small person to reach the cabinets.
On your left there is a sink, and a rack of drying dishes; on your right there is a [[beer fridge]].
Between the two sides of the kitchen, on the wall opposite the stairs, there is a window that overlooks a chimney.
There is clearly no washroom here: you are drawn by unabashed curiosity.
After exploring the kitchen you turn back to the [[rest of the room|eager double]].



#beer fridge
Though it is small like a beer fridge, it turns out to be full not of beer, but of vegetables and sauces.
It looks like you could cook a nice stir-fry or stew with these ingrediants.
You wonder whether your food is getting cold, or whether anyone is beginning to wonder why you are taking so long.
If they come and ask, you think, you will just say you got lost.
[[Stepping back from the fridge|eager aunt]] you wonder, "what will I say if they do not come looking?"


#devil arts
The raised terrace is nice.
You can barely make out the muffled sound of boring conversation down below.
The terrace overlooks a garden, which you have now seen from two angles, since it is visible from the dining room also.
You notice that there is a second balcony above this one, but not covering it.
You breath in the night air and think that maybe now you are ready to go back to the dining room.
First though, you [[step back inside|eager double]].



#devil brats
This is clearly a study, or writing room.
There are several computer monitors set up around a desk.
You doubt you will find any hints as to where the bathroom is, but all those darkenned monitors look like they really want to be woken up.
Touch [[the mouse|devil brats amend]], maybe? There is a [[sliding door|devil brats behold]] on the right as you walk into the room.
You briefly consider not touching the mouse, and just stepping back into the [[hallway|devil]].



#devil brats behold
A little library! The shades are drawn on two small windows, so there is very little light in the room.
The walls of the room are given over to bookshelves, and more encouragingly the floor is littered with little piles of books.
Squinting to read a few of the titles, you wonder how the dinner conversation could be so dreary given the subjects here.
Maybe the librarian is out tonight? Knowing you do not have enough time to really get anywhere with any of these books, you [[step back into the office|devil brats]].



#candor bramble asp
In spite of yourself, you step in to the room and crouch down to examine the doll house.
There is a modern doll perched on the roof, dangling its naked feet infront of one of the windows, but aside from that the house looks neglected.
The inside is dark; looking in through one of the windows reminds you of a { childhood memory }.
After a moment, you leave the room and head back to the [[hallway|second home foyer narrow hallway]].



#candor bramble
You step into a bedroom belonging to a child bedroom.
There are posters of teenage rock idols and recent action movies, covering up wallpaper that was clearly chosen for a girl.
The room is a mess, not in terms of clutter or things out of place, but rather in terms of the message.
There are soccer trophies, some { game machine }, a variety of stuffed animals on the bed, and an [[elaborate dollhouse|candor bramble asp]].
Standing here feels a little awkward, but afterall you are a bit of a { voyeur }.
After a moment you step back out into the [[hallway|candor]].
  game machine: you know which one it is, but its not important.
  voyeur: you have always taken a special pleasure in stepping into the life of another for a moment; you imagine shouldering their burdens and fighting their battles, and somehow this makes you happy.



#eager beaver
The balcony is a little suspect.
It trends downward, under the weight of patio furniture and a small barbeque.
There is enough space here to sit six, and a large umbrella is folded and leans agains the side of the building.
Must be nice in the summer.
From here you can see the moon, in the east, and a great big guiding star.
After pausing for a moment to enjoy the quiet night air, you [[step back into the attic|second home foyer great room]].



#devil brats amend
You look around before giving the mouse a little nudge.
Monitors come to life, and the dimly lit room is awash with color.
It seems your host is host to an architect also, or maybe she is in the realestate business: the monitors feature floor plans to a variety of houses.
There is a [[sliding door|devil brats behold double]] on the right as you walk into the room, but you can also step back into the [[hallway|devil]].



#devil brats behold double
A little library! The shades are drawn on two small windows, so there is very little light in the room.
The walls of the room are given over to bookshelves, and more encouragingly the floor is littered with little piles of books.
Squinting to read a few of the titles, you wonder how the dinner conversation could be so dreary given the subjects here.
Maybe the librarian is out tonight? Knowing you do not have enough time to really get anywhere with any of these books, you [[step back into the office|second home foyer]].



#candor denver altaic
You walk in to the enormous closet, feeling as though it might be hiding a secret washroom.
Instead you find it to be filled with shirts, pants, dresses, and anything else that can be put on a hanger.
On the floor there are a number of clear plastic boxes full of this and that.
Everything is nicely organized, in some places even { colour coordinated }, but you cannot help  but feel it is a poor use of space.
Not wanting to linger, you step back into the [[master bedroom|second home foyer mud room]].
  colour coordinated: who does that?


#candor denver
This is clearly a master bedroom (perhaps the master bedroom).
You notice the door to [[a walk in closet|candor denver altaic]] in the far right corner of the room as you enter.
The bed here is wide and low, and pushed up against a heavily curtained window.
On the left side of the room there is a dresser, and an impressive standing mirror, next to a desktop computer on an Ikea table.
There is a large world map on the wall next to the computer, with little coloured pins driven into it here and there.
After looking around for a moment, you turn to go back into the [[hallway|second home foyer MB hallway]].



#eager crabby
The studio space consists of a nice big north facing window, and a number of easels set up with canvases in various stages of completion.
One of the more complete works is an elaborate street scene set in the tree lined streets east of commercial: old houses and older trunks.
Some of the paintings look to be the works of an { amateur }, and others of an enthusiastic { child }.
There are pots of paint on the ground.
You spend a moment to appreciate the works, and only when you are sure the washroom is nowhere to be found in them do you turn back to consider the rest of the [[attic|devil brats]].
  amateur: that is, they look like experiments in technique or explorations more than polished finished works. You have always prefered amateurs, which I suppose is why you are here now.
  child: her subject mater is more mature, you feel.



#candor eagle archer
You open the cabinet doors and find that they reveal a laundry shoot! The back of the cabinet has been cut away to reveal the little laundry shoot that must have been part of the original design.
With a smile on your face you [[Step back from the cabinet|second home foyer]].



#candor eagle
The cabinet looks large enough to hold coats, but you remember your host taking your coat in the foyer.
Though it is not likely to be the bathroom, you feel a little curious... maybe you should [[open the cabinet|candor eagle archer]]? On the other hand, maybe you should [[step back|candor]] and go through one of the doors.



#second home foyer deck two
The backyard of this old house is something to write home about.
You cannot make out all of the details in the twilight, but you can see a picturesque tree-house, a swing-set, love seats, and a little pond.
There might be more out there, fenced in by hedges, but you will not know for sure unless you stay the night (which is looking more and more likely).
With that, you step in off the [[deck|eager double]].



#second home foyer deck one
The backyard of this old house is something to write home about.
You cannot make out all of the details in the twilight, but you can see a picturesque tree-house, a swing-set, love seats, and a little pond.
There might be more out there, fenced in by hedges, but you will not know for sure unless you stay the night (which is looking more and more likely).
With that, you step in off the [[deck|devil]].



#second home foyer hearth
It is a lovely hearth with a few baubles on it.
Chief among them is an intricate snow globe, featuring a tiny replica house.
Naturally, you pick it up and send the snow flakes crashing about, before [[wandering off again|candor]].



#second home foyer great room
You pass into the great room of this old house.
Furniture all around.
The room is about 20 square feet, with a [[hearth|second home foyer hearth]] dominating the left side of the room as you walk in.
The far side of the room is given over to two sets of [[glass double doors|second home foyer deck one]] (one [[closer to the hearth|second home foyer deck two]]).
On your right, the walls open up [[into the morning room/kitchen|second home foyer morning room]].
You can also leave this room by passing through an [[arched traverse|second home foyer]] into the foyer, across from the glass double doors.



#second home foyer morning room
It is not morning, so the morning room is not operating at peak lovelyness (but you can imagine).
On the far side of the room as you walk in there is a small breakfast or luncheon table below a wide window.
The left side of the room is completely open, with just a small step down into the [[grand room|second home foyer great room]].
The right side of the room is, odly enough, a small (apparently well stocked) kitchen.
No doubt this is a modern addition; maybe there used to be a wall dividing the two.
A [[hallway|second home foyer narrow hallway]] leads away from the kitchen parallel to a small [[arched traverse|second home foyer]] through which you can see the foyer.



#second home foyer small office
Oh! This is not a storage room as you had asumed, but rather a small office! Kind of a dreadful little place: there are no windows on any of the walls, and the room is uncomfortably warm on account of several desktops.
You have no clue what could motivate someone to spend their time in here, and so you step back into the [[mud room|devil brats behold]].



#second home foyer pantry
You are standing in a little pantry.
This pantry is stocked for prepairing meals, rather than for snacking and contains a freezer and a fridge, as well as shelves full of jars.
It looks like your host does some of their own pickling, as there are a number of jars full of lemons, carrots, beats, and such suspended in colourful liquids.
Not much in the way of jerky or dried fruit.
Now that you have taken stock, you feel ready to [[leave the pantry|second home foyer narrow hallway]].



#second home foyer narrow hallway
The hallway is narrow and the ceiling is not high.
The walls are nicely painted now, but you assume that in the past they were much more bland.
There is a [[heavy looking door|second home foyer mud room]] on the right and a [[smaller door|second home foyer pantry]] on the left.
The hallway opens into the [[dining room|second home foyer dining room]] on one side and a [[spacious kitchen|second home foyer morning room]] on the other.



#second home foyer mud room
This is a mud room, for scraping off your boots.
There are two doors, [[one on the right|second home foyer laundry]] and [[one of the left|second home foyer small office]] leading into storage rooms (presumably).
There is also an exterior door here, but you would not be interested in that I think (the nearest public washroom is quite a walk).
The heavy door to the mud room is ajar, and you can see the [[hallway beyond|second home foyer narrow hallway]].



#second home foyer laundry
You step into a small laundry room.
Three little machines sleep here: a washer, a drier, and something larger that is maybe for sheets.
There is a shelf near the door with some cleaning agents, but little else.
Without much thought, you step back into the [[mud room|second home foyer mud room]].



#second home foyer MB hallway
A long hallway that ends with a door.
The hallway is decorated with old portraits, but no photos...  you wonder how many relatives one family can have.
There are portraits like these in your house too, but not as many.
The door [[up ahead|second home foyer master bedroom]] looks to be a bedroom, which gives you hope.
These older collonial houses often had washrooms attached to the master bedroom, you seem to recal.
You can also see the foyer down the [[other end of the hallway|second home foyer]].



#second home foyer
The foyer is a grand place, with a heigh ceiling and stained glass windows next to the door.
A rug at the foot of a great staircase dominates the foyer.
The stairs split halfway up, into a "T", and under each branch is an arched traverse into the rooms beyond.
The stairs divide the room into left and right (facing the stairs): on the left there is a [[foggy glass paned double door|second home foyer office]], a [[hallway|second home foyer MB hallway]], and an [[arched traverse|second home foyer great room]] leading into what looks like a large relatively empty room; on the right there is a pair of [[french sliding doors|second home foyer dining room]], a [[small door|second home foyer powder]] with a picture hanging on it, and again an [[arched traverse|second home foyer morning room]] through which can be seen a kitchen of sorts.



#second home foyer powder
You push open the delicate door into a tiny powder room.
A convenient thing to have in a foyer...  if only it was also a washroom.
A large mirror cabinet, probably full of powder, and a little sink make up the only significant fixtures in this room.
You consider running a bit of water over your hands, but hesitate  since you do actually need to find a washroom.
With that in mind, you step back into the [[foyer|second home foyer]].



#second home foyer master bathroom
You flip a light-switch on the wall and look about the room.
This is a bathroom, without a doubt.
An enormous bathtub, large enough for three or four, dominates the left side of the room.
Behind it is a window with wooden blinds, so that light can filter through.
The sink, low cabinets, and wall mirror are equally splendid, stretching ten feet across and trimmed with gold and silver fixtures.
There is no toilet here, but there is a [[small door|second home foyer pantry]] with a glass handle on the right side of the room.



#second home foyer master bedroom
This is a master bedroom.
The bed is enormouse, and well made.
A grey curtain hangs over the back of it, and a long shock of grey fabric covers its foot.
Below the foot of the bed is a pair of stools, each with a tiny pillow.
You wonder whether anyone actually uses this room; if so, then they must hire cleaners.
There is a tall mirrored chest beside an even taller window, curtained with the same grey material common throughout the room.
Beside the bed, on the right, is a little night-stand with an adorable lamp.
Standing at the threshold of this well preserved room, you feel the urge to just turn around and go [[back where you came|candor arbor]].
However, there is also a promising looking [[door|second home foyer master bathroom]] in the far right corner of the room...



#second home foyer office
You push open the door and find yourself in a tight little office.
Everything in the office is conveniently within reach of a little wooden office chair in its center.
There is a curtained window to your left, and a little potted fern below that.
The desk that dominates much of the room looks like it aught to have a typewritter on it, but instead is home to a large laptop.
There is a small shelf of books against the right wall.
Mostly these are reference material: Whoever sits in this office is interested comparative law, and aboriginal title in particular.
Satisfied, you head back to the [[foyer|candor bramble]].



#second home foyer dining room
This dinning room is far too big, and fortunately it is empty.
You would hate to wander back into the dining room you had left, without finding the washroom.
There are a number of windows on the west side of the room, cleverly placed so as to maximize daylight.
The dinning table is quite enormous, and round.
It almost looks too big for the room, with the chairs neatly tucked in and the table-cloth in a neutral color.
A [[long narrow hallway|second home foyer narrow hallway]] opposite the windows leads away from the dinning room, but you can also walk into the [[foyer|second home foyer]].
