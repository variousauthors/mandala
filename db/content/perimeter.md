#dinning table
Only after carefully weighing the competing social pressures did you finally accept the invitation to dinner tonight.
That is to say, you did not want to come but... well these things have a way of drawing you in.
Needless to say, you feel terrible: the conversations going on around you swing back and forth between { jargon } and { chatter }.
You feel as though you have not heard a single meaningful utterance since you stepped into the foyer.
"Excuse me," you say, "may I ask directions to the washroom?"
"Oh of course! Right at the top of the stairs, my dear fellow."
This at least will give you a moment to breath, put water on your face, and massage the muscles of your jaw.
You step out of your chair and into the [[foyer|angle]].
  chatter: unbearably banal conversations about the weather, or the food, or the house.
  jargon: professionals estabilshing their intelligence by being incomprehensible.
