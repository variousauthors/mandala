#long hall deck garden entrance
You are standing in the center of a narrow wooden deck pressed between the side of a gorgeous old Japanese { house }, and a stunning walled { garden }.|500|
  house: Most of the house is off limits. It has not been lived in for decades, and is now more of a cultural relic.
  garden: The pond is the attraction.
The deck is not completely open: where you are standing there is a small plain step down into the [ garden | mossy checker-board ].|100|
It is mostly fenced off from the garden by tightly spaced beams of a slightly lighter wood tone than the floor.|200|
Cast against these beams, the sunlight is split into shafts that paint the deck, and the west wall of the house.|200|
The [ garden | mossy checker-board ] is dominated by a pond in the center, and two handsome old trees growing in the south-east corner.|200|
The deck continues [ north | long hall deck northeast ] and [ south | long hall deck south ], between the wooden beams and the pale rice paper walls, all along the side of the old house, until it runs into the garden wall on both sides.|500|
